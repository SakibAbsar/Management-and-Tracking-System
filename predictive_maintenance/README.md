## Predictive Maintenance Dashboard

This module provides a predictive maintenance dashboard using MATLAB and IoT sensors to monitor and predict potential equipment failures. It allows users to visualize equipment performance data and receive alerts about potential issues before they lead to failures.

### Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Collects data from IoT sensors to monitor equipment health.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Utilizes historical data to forecast potential equipment failures.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Developed using MATLAB to provide an intuitive interface for users.

### How to Use
1. Ensure MATLAB is installed on your machine.
2. Connect your IoT sensors to collect data.
3. Run the MATLAB script to launch the dashboard.

### MATLAB Script
- Place your MATLAB script in the `predictive_maintenance/` directory.
- Example script might include:
```matlab
% Example MATLAB script for predictive maintenance
% Load sensor data
data = readtable('sensor_data.csv');
% Predictive maintenance logic here
% Display results
```
